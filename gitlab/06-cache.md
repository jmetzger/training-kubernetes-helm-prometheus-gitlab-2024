# Using the cache 

## Difference to artifacts 

  * Normally used, when you need dependencies 
  * A shared cache with s3 can be used 
  * Not possible to download it (not exposed) 
  * Mainly for saving time when build, e.g. 
    * libraries, executables are built -> tages time 
    * want to reuse it in next stage
